# Bolt #
  Run against your neighborhood.

## Summary ##
  Bolt is the first head-to-head app that puts you and your neighborhood on the racetrack.

## Problem ##
  Getting into exercise can be daunting. We may keep it up for a few days, but fall off after a week or so (or worse, put it off altogether). Since there is little incentive to continue or exceed goals, routinely developing an exercise routine all by oneself can limit potential.

## Solution ##
  With Bolt, diving into running is now a social, competitive, and fun experience! Using specified running preferences, Bolt will pair up two different users to compete in a spur-of-the-moment footrace to a Bolt-defined location. The first user to the location wins!

## Quote from You ##
  "We think that running can be a lot more fun with friends from your community- not only is this app a way to get more fit, but to build strong bonds in your neighborhood."

  -Bolt, inc.

## How to Get Started ##
  With Bolt, getting started is as easy as lacing up and tapping "Bolt now". You'll be matched up with another runner and will be given the location of the finish line - and the race starts right away!

## Customer Quote ##
  "I couldn't believe how fun running could be after using Bolt. I used to be afraid of the sun and eat ramen noodles inside all day, but now, I race daily and am the victor of my neighborhood!"

  -Johnny Sprintzer
