# Bolt #
  Run against your neighborhood.

## Summary ##
  Running is fun again. Bolt is the first head-to-head app that puts you and your neighborhood on the racetrack.

## Problem ##
  Getting into exercise can be daunting. We may keep it up for a few days, but fall off after a week or so (or worse, put it off altogether). Since there is little incentive or accountability to exceed personal goals, normal exercise routines are rarely followed through on.

## Solution ##
  With Bolt, diving into exercise is now a social, competitive, and fun experience! Using specified running preferences, Bolt will pair up two different users to compete in a spur-of-the-moment footrace to a Bolt-defined location. The first user to the location wins!

  Bolt can also be used as a personal trainer for your solo runs. Along with displaying a destination based on your preferences, Bolt will give a target time in which to shoot for - so although you may be alone, you're always racing against the clock!

## Quote from You ##
  "We think that running can be a lot more fun with friends from your community- not only is this app a way to get more fit, but to build strong bonds in your neighborhood."

## How to Get Started ##
  With Bolt, getting started is as easy as lacing up and tapping "Bolt now". You'll be matched up with another runner and will be given the location of the finish line - and the race starts right away!

## Customer Quote ##
